# PDM_ShiftApp

Work Shift app challange made with React Native and Google Firebase as backend.

# How it works
The app admits two types of users: Administrator and Workers

Administrator account: admin@email.com <br>
Worker account: any other email

Admins see all workers and their tasks and can remove tasks from them <br>
Worker users can view their tasks, and remove them when done

Usernames can be updated in profile screen

Thats it...
